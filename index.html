          <h2>Odena Essie Melton believed in cookies.</h2>
          <p>
            The cookie jar she kept in her cupboard was never empty. She made
            sure there was something in there to share with the family.
            Before I was born, the lid had been broken - but rather than buy a
            new jar, Maw-Maw put a bowl over the top to keep the cookies fresh.
            Waste not, want not!
            <br><br>
            I learned a lot from my grandmother before her passing, and after I
            received a book of my in-law's famliy recipes as a wedding present, I
            was thrilled to add those from my own family.
            <br><br>
            Using real ingredients and home-grown resourcefulness,
            our foremothers tested and perfected their recipes across decades
            and now - inspired by Maw-Maw's cookie jar - we're sharing
            them with you!
